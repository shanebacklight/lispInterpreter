**Goal**: convert a mixed s-expression to a pure dot notation<br>
**Manual**<br>
1. Atom only consists of uppercase letters and integers
2. Enter a s-expression followed by a in a single $ or $$
3. It is allowed to appending a single or $ or $$ to any empty expression(only spaces)
4. After input a single $$, please press any key to exit
